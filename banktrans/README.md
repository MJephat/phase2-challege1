# REACT Code First Challenge

This project was build using React and tested the ability to use 
components on a web app and design the UI (User interface) as well 
as performing some functions like live_search, edit (update), delete and add.
Basically was testing CRUD. Create, Read, Update and Delete.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm test`

No tests were set to be run because this was an application that was to be created from scratch.





### Code Splitting

The projects consist of many components
